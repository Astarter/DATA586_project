# Data 586 Project

## Next Meeting tasks (April 23 at 1:00 pm Kelowna time):
- Connor: 
	- Create the 9 dataframes for the event types
	- one hot encoding the dataframes
	- merge dataframes into one dataframe on block ids. 
	- review structure of research papers. 
- Ben: 
	- Help on onehot encoding
	- Determine how to implement logistic regression model in python
	- Have a demo version of the model. 

## Project to do:

1. Create github repo
2. Data wrangling on the raw data
	a. create a structure
	b. find the unique events and then do onehot encoding on them to change textual data to numerical data. 
		i. learn what onehot encoding is. 
3. Decide on the type of model we want to use
	a. algorithms or neural networks
4. Build the model
	a. train and test it
5. write the paper 

keep a list of references for the report.
