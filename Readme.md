# Data 586 Project

## Next Meeting tasks (April 17 at 11:00 am Kelowna time):
- Perform individual data wrangling to isolate the log events and discuss findings at the next meeting.
- Connor: Focus on data wrangling and isolating the event types and input for onehot encoding
- Ben: Learn about onehot encoding and determine how we should use it in this project.  

## Project to do:

1. Create github repo
2. Data wrangling on the raw data
	a. create a structure
	b. find the unique events and then do onehot encoding on them to change textual data to numerical data. 
		i. learn what onehot encoding is. 
3. Decide on the type of model we want to use
	a. algorithms or neural networks
4. Build the model
	a. train and test it
5. write the paper 

keep a list of references for the report.
